  # Hardware sensors reading
  # Choose the appropriate method for reading your hardware sensors:
  # - PYTHON         use Python libraries (psutils, GPUtil...) to read hardware sensors (supports all OS but not all HW)
  # - LHM            use LibreHardwareMonitor library to read hardware sensors (Windows only - NEEDS ADMIN RIGHTS)
  # - STUB / STATIC  use random/static data instead of real hardware sensors
  # - AUTO           use the best method based on your OS: Windows OS will use LHM, other OS will use Python libraries
  HW_SENSORS: LHM

  # Network interfaces
  # Linux/MacOS interfaces are named "eth0", "wlan0", "wlp1s0", "enp2s0"...
  # For Windows use the interfaces pretty name: "Ethernet 2", "Wi-Fi", ...
  # Leave the fields empty if the card does not exist on your setup
  ETH: ''     # Ethernet Card
  WLO: ''     # Wi-Fi Card

  # CPU fan
  # For Linux/MacOS platforms, the CPU fan is amongst all fan sensors gathered from the motherboard chipset
  # If value is AUTO the system monitor will try to auto-select the CPU fan
  # If auto-detection fails, it might be necessary to manually indicate which fan is the CPU fan
  # Value must be 'controller/fan' e.g. 'nct6798/fan2'. Use configuration wizard for help in selection
  CPU_FAN: AUTO

  # Address used for ping sensor. Can be internal/external IP (e.g. 8.8.8.8 or 192.168.0.1) or hostname (google.com)
